                                PHP-ArubaCloud-OpenPanel
================================================================================================

This is a kind of quick reference about "Aruba OpenPanel" PHP project.

This project is based on CakePHP v2.x framework and for this reason all specific source files
are within the "app" folder; inside that, you can find the classic Cake's hierarchy with a 
particular package named "Aruba".

In the "Aruba" folder are present all that classes that bind the methods exposed by the main 
webservice end-point: WsEndUser - version 1.4.
These elements have been created thanks to the "Walle WSDL2PHP" Generator (v1.5.1-6) downloadable
from this url: https://github.com/walle/wsdl2phpgenerator.

In that folder you can also find a PHP script file named "invocation-example.php" where are coded
a full list of call examples, with also WS client configurations.

The main classes within this folder are:

- WSEndUser    that is generated by "walle" generator  [(*)see footnote about this step]
- WsEndUSerExt that is a subclass of WSEndUser and implements the authentication process (filling the SOAP header).
  Also, it implements the "WSEndpoint" interface and defines some connection parameters (SOAP protocol etc.)
- WsEndUserClient  is the main client class, that maps all usefull webservice's methods 
  and uses a 'WsEndUSerExt' as constructor parameter to get authentication capabilities.
- WsEndUserVDCConfigClient is the client class - similar to 'WsEndUserClient' that contains VDC (Virtual DataCenter)
  Configuration info.


If you want/need to regenerate a new set of classes (for example to bind a new WsEndUser version) you have
to use the "WALLE Generator" tool to bind a WSDL definition and than put all its artifacts into the "Aruba"
folder, KEEPING the originals WsEndUserExt, WSEndUserClient and WsEndUserVDCConfigClient. 



(*) WALLE Generation: the generation process performed by WALLE Generator creates a set of classes and
a main "WsEndUser" element. This element contains some little mistakes but is very easy remove them thaks
to any PHP editor.
